    content: ("After obtaining a diploma in Hotel and Catering Management from Norwich City College, U.K.,\\
      Peter worked in the hotel and restaurant industry in the U.K. and Canada.\\
      Under his management London's famous CafÃ© Royal was awarded a prestigious Michelin Star.\\
      After moving back to the Okanagan to raise his family, Peter worked as a chef at several of the South Okanagan's finest restaurants,\\
      including Hillside Estate Winery.

      In 2000, in response to the demand for the vinaigrettes served in the Bistro at Hillside Estate Winery, Peter began bottling and selling\\
      the Roast Garlic Balsamic Vinaigrette. Being at a winery meant access to bottles and a retail outlet so and Wineland Dressings was born.

      Since then Wineland Dressings has moved to a dedicated commercial kitchen in Penticton, B.C. and grown to include 6 specialty vinaigrettes,\\
      all made with local Okanagan and B.C. ingredients.

      The name Wineland Dressings is a nod to the Okanagan Valley's rich history of winemaking and the role it played in the creation of the company.").gsub("\\\n", " "),
